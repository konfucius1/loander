# Loander
Loander connects borrowers and lenders in a Tinder-like swiping experience, fostering community-driven financial support.

## Overview
The global financial landscape is vast and diverse. Yet, many individuals find it challenging to access small loans at reasonable rates. LendMatch aims to address this gap, providing a platform where borrowers and lenders can meet, discuss terms, and forge connections based on mutual financial interests.

## Features
1. **User Profiles**: Custom profiles for borrowers and lenders, showcasing their financial needs or offerings.
2. **Matching System**: Swipe through profiles to express interest, with mutual matches opening communication channels.
3. **Secure Communication**: Initial communication within the platform ensures privacy and safety.
4. **Community-Driven**: Foster a sense of community with a platform that's built on trust and mutual support.

## How It Works
1. **Sign Up**: Create a borrower or lender profile.
2. **Browse**: Swipe through profiles, expressing interest in potential matches.
3. **Match**: When two users mutually express interest, they are matched.
4. **Connect**: Mutual matches can communicate, exchange contact details, and discuss loan terms.

This project is a work in progress under CISSA's annual hackathon: Catalyst 2023 of the FinTech track. It is heavily inspired by Tinder and ultimately a whimsical project that should not be taken seriously by legal means.
